# UIFader-Classic
Addon for fading away selected parts of the default UI to the set opacity. You can set how long till the fading process begins and how long it lasts.UI is brought back when player enters combat or opens a bag for example. You can set which events bring back the UI. This addon was developed with the default UI in mind, I don't know how it works if you have UI modifications. Any comment on how this project could be improved is appreciated.
