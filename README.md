# UIFader-Classic
Addon to fade away parts of the default UI.
UI is brought back when player enters combat or opens a bag for example. You can set which events bring back the UI. This addon was developed with the default UI in mind, I don't know how it works if you have UI modifications. Any comment on how this project could be improved is appreciated.
